### KidScore Tracking 
It is a very simple user friendly web site, helps in transfaring from paper-based system to digital system.
From its name it helps children from 10 - 15 years to track their score
and their mentors to add, delete and update the child data.
It build on an idea of replacing the paper-based coubon which the mentor gives to child based on his performance and avoiding the high cost of printing this coubon
to more digital way to save the cost and avoiding the memorizing total number of points and losing the coubon itself.
